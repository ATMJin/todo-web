# todo-web
A Simple todo app run in browser. This project do not have any extenal dependcies.

Bugs:
- A deleted to-do item re-appear on reload
- Enter at the input box cannot add item
- Reload at finished list will go to the doing list

Tasks, with priority:
1. Fix the above bugs
2. Event binding and view rendering is mixed up, try to separate them
3. Design and suggest an API for saveing the todolist on a server
4. Any refractoring you think will make the code better
